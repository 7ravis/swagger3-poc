# swagger3-poc

## Description
This is a simple proof-of-concept for auto-generating OpenAPI 3 documentation for a Spring Boot web project. The tool that I used to generate the base project was [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), and the documentation is generated by [springdoc-openapi](https://springdoc.org/) (see their documentation for more about custom configuration).

## Getting Started
This was as simple as it gets: I just [added the springdoc dependency to my Spring Boot web project](https://github.com/7ravis/swagger3-poc/commit/7acf03e71fa615a060d4b7030164587517f20553), [ran my project](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/#_run_the_application), and the default config found my endpoints and deployed two new endpoints: one exposing OpenAPI 3 documentation as JSON and one as HTML (swagger-ui).

If you run this demo project locally on port 8080 (the default), the documentation would be deployed at http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs (JSON) and http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html (HTML, swagger-ui).
